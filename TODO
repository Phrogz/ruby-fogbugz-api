== FogBugz API Todo

* Finish it!  At the moment it is very incomplete.  Pretty much just the list functions, search, and new_case.  Essentially take a look at the FogBugz API and see what is missing. Specifically:
  * Case manipulation
    * edit, assign, reactivate, reopen, resolve, close, email, reply, forward
  * file uploads
  * working schedule
  * time tracking
  * source control
  * release notes
  * wikis
  * discussion groups
  * BugzScout
  * subscriptions
  * mark as viewed
  * settings
* Create tests and make sure they work.
